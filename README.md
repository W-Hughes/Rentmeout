# RentMeOut

## Introduction

RentMeOut is a platform designed to facilitate the rental and sharing of idle machinery, promoting a sharing economy. This project was developed as part of my ALX Software Engineering Foundations Portfolio Project to showcase my skills in front-end development. I utilized **Vue.js** for building a reactive single-page application (SPA) and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling. I worked alone on this project (originally intended for a team of three: William Kwesi Hughes) due to team unavailability, and I successfully deployed the app to GitHub Pages in March 2025.

## Project Overview

RentMeOut aims to connect individuals who own idle machinery with those who need to rent such equipment, reducing waste and fostering community collaboration. The app is currently a front-end-only MVP, with plans to integrate a back-end in future iterations for full functionality, including user authentication, listing management, and booking capabilities.

### Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: For building a reactive and component-based front-end.
- **Vue Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Vuex**: For state management (e.g., managing user authentication).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app with a utility-first approach.
- **FontAwesome**: For adding icons to enhance the UI.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the deployed application.

## Features

RentMeOut provides a user-friendly interface with the following key features:

- **Landing Page**: Introduces the platform with an overview, key features, and developer information.
- **Listing Creation**: Allows users to create listings for their idle machinery (simulated in the front-end).
- **Browsing Listings**: Enables users to browse available machinery for rent.
- **Listing Details**: Displays detailed information about a specific listing.
- **User Authentication**: Simulated login and role-based access (admin and participant roles) using `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
